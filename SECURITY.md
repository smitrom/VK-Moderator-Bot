Hi Mr. MVoz,
I tring to build gdal and i faced with issue which (ERDAS ECW JPEG 2000 SDK 5.4.0/lib/vc143/x64)
'NCSEcw/ECW/Compress.h': No such file or directory	gdal_ECW_JP2ECW	ecw-4.3\include\NCSEcw\API\View.h	55	
i found the ecw-4.3 on your repo. I tried to sign up to send community access request but website said under maintainance.
Are there any chance to share ERDAS ECW JPEG 2000 SDK 5.4.0 with me? ( pathxxpal@gmail.com ) thank you for understanding
